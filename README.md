LineCoach is a tool designed to help actors memorize their lines more efficiently. 

Learning lines is a tedious task that can take a lot of time. Most actors hate that part and want to focus solely on the acting one, but with LineCoach, the process is quicker, easier and funnier. 

LineCoach uses advanced techniques to assist actors in remembering their lines, reducing the stress and frustration associated with the memorization process. 

You can work on your own or with your partners if they're online, making the learning process collaborative and human-centred.

This makes LineCoach an essential tool for actors who want to focus on their craft and improve their performance.

> The gist of the matter is not in the text. The text will come of itself when I feel the role.

_Konstantin Stanislavski_


Learning a text is too complicated, the experience for the actor is broken and outdated. The strong emotions and aesthetics that an actor offers on stage cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence, but technology can help the actor to get closer and closer to mastering the text in order to concentrate on the play and the feeling.


The first and most apparent problem with learning is that when we read a paper script, we can easily see the first few words of our line, giving an easy clue as to what we should say at that moment. Even if we can cleverly hide with our hand the line we are practicing, we can easily guess the size of it, helping us to remember whether it is the moment of the long monologue or the one where our character nods with an onomatopoeia.
When the text is printed, our spatial memory comes on board and helps us remember what we are saying when we get to the bottom of page 3, or just before the start of scene 4 of Act II.
This is all part of a normal process of our brain using techniques to remember. But the sheet will not be on stage on the day of the performance, so all these tricks will become useless, a convenient shortcut in our rehearsals will handicap us at the most opportune moment: the scene

_ðŸŽ­ This is why in LineCoach we can change the format of the text in order to lose the bearings we have acquired in our learning. This is also why we can hide our lines; once hidden, it is impossible to know the initial size of the line. But don't panic; if our memory fails us, we click a button to display it temporarily, validate what we say and continue practicing._

A text should be known at the tip of one's fingers. An actor should be able to recite it while cooking or playing sports. An actor should be able to recite it with equal accuracy and precision by varying the style, for example, by singing it, declaiming it very slowly or very quickly, or reciting it with an exaggerated accent.

_ðŸŽ­ This is why in LineCoach we have a module that allows you to practice an entire scene by yourself. When you start a practice session, other people's lines will be read by artificial intelligence, and when it's time for your line, you'll have all the time in the world to make different variations to break the routine of the text._


In the comfort of your bedroom or the peace and quiet of a rehearsal room, the actor will start over if he or she makes a mistake or if an external element has disturbed the session. But not on stage. On stage, anything can happen. An audience member can have a heart attack, the show will be paused, and they will have to start again 30 minutes later, out of context. An actor must know his lines inside out and be able to continue his lines from any phrase in another line or from his own.

_ðŸŽ­ This is why in LineCoach we have a feature that allows an actor to randomly prompt the last sentence of a line so that he continues from there. This game reinforces the memory and reassures the actor that he can handle events that may happen on stage._


Every actor has a different memory, and some remember a text better when they simply read it, when they recite it aloud, when they hear it or when they are in a group. Every actor should find the right technique in a learning tool.

_ðŸŽ­ That's why in LineCoach, if other actors are logged in at the same time as you, you will be informed and you can start a huddle with them to practice as a group._
